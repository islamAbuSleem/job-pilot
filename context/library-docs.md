# Library Docs

Project-specific usage patterns for every third party library in this project. This file only covers how we use each library in this specific project — rules, patterns, and constraints specific to JobPilot.

Read the relevant section before implementing any feature that touches these libraries.

---

## Before Using Any Library

Before implementing any feature that uses a third party library:

1. **Check AGENTS.md** at the project root — it lists every skill installed for this project and how to use them. Skills contain up-to-date API documentation, usage patterns, and best practices specific to this codebase.

2. **Check if an MCP server is configured** for that library. Some tools have MCP servers that give the AI agent direct access to documentation, logs, and debugging tools. If an MCP server is available — use it before falling back to general knowledge.

3. **Read this file** for project-specific patterns that override general library knowledge.

The order of authority is:

```
MCP server (real-time docs) → Skills via AGENTS.md → This file (project rules) → General training knowledge
```

Never rely on general training knowledge alone for library APIs — they change frequently and training data may be outdated.

---

## InsForge

**Check first:** Read `.agents/skills/insforge/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/insforge/auth/ssr-integration.md` before implementing any InsForge feature. Those are the live, authoritative references for the current `@insforge/sdk` API. This section is a project-level supplement, not the source of truth.

### Project link

- Linked project: `islam_jobPilot` (region `eu-central`).
- Link state lives in `.insforge/project.json` (git-ignored). Re-link with `npx -y @insforge/cli link`.
- Pull the anon key with `npx -y @insforge/cli secrets get ANON_KEY`.
- Manage declarative project config (auth redirect URLs, password policy, verification method, etc.) via `insforge.toml` + `npx -y @insforge/cli config apply --auto-approve`.

### Client vs Server

Two separate instances — never mix them. Use `@insforge/sdk/ssr` (not the older separate `@insforge/ssr` package).

```typescript
// lib/insforge-client.ts — Client Components only
import { createBrowserClient } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";

export const insforge = createBrowserClient();
```

```typescript
// lib/insforge-server.ts — Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions, agent
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { createServerClient } from "@insforge/sdk/ssr";

export async function createInsforgeServer() {
  return createServerClient({
    cookies: await cookies(),
  });
}
```

**Rules:**

- The browser client is **read-only** for auth: only `getCurrentUser()`, `getProfile()`, `getPublicAuthConfig()`. All auth **mutations** (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, OAuth initiation/exchange, email verification, password reset) must run on the server via `createAuthActions()`.
- The server client reads `insforge_access_token` from cookies and passes it as a per-request bearer. The refresh token stays server-owned (httpOnly).
- For trusted server-only code that needs project-admin access, use `createAdminClient({ apiKey })` from `@insforge/sdk` (not `/ssr`).
- Never use the browser client in server context. Never use the server client in browser context.

### Cookies

Default cookies (managed by SDK helpers — do not invent your own names):

| Cookie | Visibility | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `insforge_access_token` | httpOnly: false (browser-readable) | Short-lived bearer for Server Components, Client Components, Storage, Realtime |
| `insforge_refresh_token` | httpOnly: true (server-only) | Long-lived refresh credential |
| `insforge_code_verifier` | httpOnly: true (during OAuth flow) | PKCE verifier, 10-minute lifetime, deleted on callback success |

### Required infrastructure for any auth flow

1. `/api/auth/refresh` route — `createRefreshAuthRouter()` from `@insforge/sdk/ssr`. The browser client uses it to refresh expired access tokens.
2. `proxy.ts` at the project root (Next.js 16) — `updateSession()` from `@insforge/sdk/ssr/middleware`. Keeps Server Component cookies fresh and gates protected routes. (`middleware.ts` is Next.js ≤15.)
3. `/api/auth/callback` route — `createAuthActions({ requestCookies, responseCookies })` with `exchangeOAuthCode()` to complete the SSR OAuth exchange and write auth cookies.

### Auth

```typescript
// Get current user in server context
const insforge = await createInsforgeServer();
const { data: { user } } = await insforge.auth.getCurrentUser();
if (!user) redirect("/login");

// Initiate OAuth from a Server Action
const auth = createAuthActions({ cookies: await cookies() });
const { data, error } = await auth.signInWithOAuth("google", {
  redirectTo: new URL("/api/auth/callback", process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL).toString(),
  skipBrowserRedirect: true,
});
// data.url — redirect the user here
// data.codeVerifier — store in httpOnly cookie before redirecting

// Exchange the OAuth code in the callback route
const auth = createAuthActions({
  requestCookies: request.cookies,
  responseCookies: response.cookies,
});
const { data, error } = await auth.exchangeOAuthCode(code, codeVerifier);
```

---

### DB Queries

```typescript
// Read
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_id", user.id)
  .order("found_at", { ascending: false });

// Insert — must be an array
const { data, error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .insert([{ user_id: user.id, title, company, match_score }])
  .select()
  .single();

// Update
const { error } = await insforge
  .from("jobs")
  .update({ company_research: dossier })
  .eq("id", jobId)
  .eq("user_id", user.id); // always scope to user
```

**Rules:**

- Always scope queries to `user_id` — never query without user filter
- Always handle the `error` return — never assume success
- Use `.single()` when expecting exactly one row
- **Inserts take an array**: `insert([{ ... }])` — passing a single object throws
- Reference users with `auth.users(id)`; use `auth.uid()` in RLS policies

---

### Storage

```typescript
// Upload file
const { data, error } = await insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, fileBuffer, {
    contentType: "application/pdf",
    upsert: true, // overwrites existing file
  });

// Get public URL
const { data } = insforge.storage
  .from("resumes")
  .getPublicUrl(`${userId}/resume.pdf`);

const url = data.publicUrl;
```

**Storage paths:**

- Base resume: `resumes/{user_id}/resume.pdf`

**Rules:**

- Always use `upsert: true` for base resume uploads — overwrites existing file
- Always save the public URL back to the DB after upload
- Never write files to disk — always upload buffer directly to storage
- For storage uploads, persist **both** the returned `url` AND `key` (needed for download/delete later)

---

## Adzuna API

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Adzuna skill. If none exists — use this file and the official Adzuna API docs.

### Job Search

```typescript
// lib/adzuna.ts
export async function searchJobs(
  jobTitle: string,
  location: string,
  country: string = "us",
): Promise<AdzunaJob[]> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    app_id: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_ID!,
    app_key: process.env.ADZUNA_APP_KEY!,
    what: jobTitle,
    category: "it-jobs", // always filter to IT jobs
    results_per_page: "10",
    "content-type": "application/json",
  });

  // Only add where if location is provided
  if (location) {
    params.set("where", location);
  }

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/${country}/search/1?${params}`,
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Adzuna API error: ${response.status}`);
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results || [];
}
```

### Response Shape

Each Adzuna job result contains:

```typescript
type AdzunaJob = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  company: { display_name: string };
  location: { display_name: string };
  description: string; // snippet only — not full description
  redirect_url: string; // Adzuna tracking URL → redirects to actual job
  salary_min?: number;
  salary_max?: number;
  salary_is_predicted: "0" | "1"; // "1" means salary is estimated
  contract_type?: string;
  created: string; // ISO date string
  category: { tag: string; label: string };
};
```

### Saving Jobs to DB

```typescript
// Map Adzuna result to jobs table
const jobRecord = {
  user_id: userId,
  run_id: runId,
  source: "search", // always 'search' for Adzuna jobs
  source_url: job.redirect_url,
  external_apply_url: job.redirect_url,
  title: job.title,
  company: job.company.display_name,
  location: job.location.display_name,
  salary: job.salary_min
    ? `$${Math.round(job.salary_min / 1000)}k - $${Math.round(job.salary_max! / 1000)}k`
    : null,
  job_type: job.contract_type || "fulltime",
  about_role: job.description, // Adzuna returns snippet — used as description
  match_score: scoredJob.matchScore,
  match_reason: scoredJob.matchReason,
  matched_skills: scoredJob.matchedSkills,
  missing_skills: scoredJob.missingSkills,
  found_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

**Rules:**

- Always include `category=it-jobs` — never search Adzuna without this filter
- Never pass `where` if location is empty — omit the parameter entirely
- `source` is always `'search'` for Adzuna jobs — never any other value
- `salary_is_predicted: "1"` means Adzuna estimated the salary — this is normal
- Adzuna description is a snippet — GPT-4o scores from it, not a full description
- Default country to `'us'` — support `gb`, `au`, `ca` as alternatives

---

## Browserbase

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Browserbase skill. If a Browserbase MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest session management and API patterns.

### Session Creation — Company Research

```typescript
import Browserbase from "@browserbasehq/sdk";

const bb = new Browserbase({ apiKey: process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY! });

// Single session for company research — sequential page visits
const session = await bb.sessions.create({
  projectId: process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID!,
  timeout: 120, // 2 minute session — visits 3-4 pages max
});
```

**Important — Browserbase runs independently from your Next.js server:**
Browserbase sessions run on Browserbase's cloud infrastructure, not inside your Next.js API route. The API route triggers the Browserbase session and returns a response while the session continues running independently on Browserbase's platform. Do not add `maxDuration` or any timeout configuration to Next.js API routes to accommodate Browserbase session length.

**Rules:**

- Always use single sessions — never parallel sessions (free plan limit)
- Session timeout is 120 seconds — sufficient for 3-4 page visits
- Always end sessions cleanly — call stagehand.close() when done
- Project ID always from `process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` — never hardcode
- Browserbase client lives in `lib/browserbase.ts` — always import from there

---

## Stagehand

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed Stagehand skill. If a Stagehand MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest act() and extract() patterns.

### Initialisation

```typescript
import { Stagehand } from "@browserbasehq/stagehand";

const stagehand = new Stagehand({
  env: "BROWSERBASE",
  apiKey: process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY!,
  projectId: process.env.BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID!,
  browserbaseSessionID: session.id,
  model: { modelName: "openai/gpt-4o", apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! },
  disablePino: true,
});

await stagehand.init();
const page = stagehand.context.activePage()!;
```

### extract()

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const result = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract the company overview, main product description, and any technology mentions from this page.",
  schema: z.object({
    companyOverview: z.string().optional(),
    mainProduct: z.string().optional(),
    techMentions: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
    navLinks: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          label: z.string(),
          url: z.string(),
        }),
      )
      .optional(),
  }),
});
```

### act()

```typescript
// Always wrap in try/catch
try {
  await stagehand.act({
    action: "Click the About link in the navigation",
  });
} catch (error) {
  await logAgentError(jobId, null, error);
}
```

## Company Research Section

Replace the existing Stagehand "Company Research Pattern" section in library-docs.md with this:

---

### Company Research Pattern

Three-step process: homepage extraction → sub-page extraction → GPT-4o synthesis.
Job description and user profile come from DB — never re-fetch what you already have.
Browser's only job is the company website.

```typescript
// Step 1 — Homepage extraction
const homepageData = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "This is a company's homepage. Capture what the company actually does, who it's for, and any concrete signals (funding, customers, scale, mission, recent launches). Then find the internal links most worth visiting to research them as an employer.",
  schema: z.object({
    oneLiner: z.string().describe("What the company does in one sentence"),
    productSummary: z
      .string()
      .describe("What they build/sell and who it's for"),
    signals: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Funding, notable customers, scale, mission, recent news"),
    pageLinks: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          url: z.string(),
          kind: z.enum([
            "about",
            "careers",
            "blog",
            "engineering",
            "product",
            "team",
            "other",
          ]),
        }),
      )
      .describe("Internal links worth visiting"),
  }),
});

// If oneLiner and productSummary are empty — wrong site or parked domain
// Skip to synthesis with job description and profile only
if (!homepageData.oneLiner && !homepageData.productSummary) {
  await stagehand.close();
  // proceed to synthesis with empty companyResearch
}

// Step 2 — Sub-page extraction (max 3, prefer about/blog/engineering/product over careers)
const subPageData = await stagehand.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract substance that helps a candidate understand this company before applying: what they do, their values and how they work, the specific technologies and tools they use, notable projects or customers, and how the team operates. Ignore nav, footers, cookie banners, and generic marketing copy.",
  schema: z.object({
    keyPoints: z.array(z.string()),
    technologies: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Specific languages, frameworks, tools, platforms"),
    valuesOrCulture: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Stated values, working style, team norms"),
    notable: z
      .array(z.string())
      .describe("Customers, funding, scale, projects, awards"),
  }),
});

// Step 3 — GPT-4o synthesis (after browser closes)
// Feed three data sources: company research + job from DB + profile from DB
const systemPrompt = `You are a sharp career strategist preparing a candidate to apply for a specific role. You are given (a) research collected from the company's own website, (b) the job posting, and (c) the candidate's profile. Produce a concise, concrete briefing that gives this specific candidate an edge for this specific role.

Rules:
- Ground every company claim in the provided research or job posting. Never invent funding, customers, headcount, or facts. If research was thin, infer carefully from the job posting and say what's inferred.
- Be specific to THIS candidate. Connect their actual skills and past work to this company's stack, product, and values. No generic advice that would apply to anyone.
- Turn the candidate's missing skills into a strategy: how to frame the gap honestly and what adjacent experience to lean on.
- Talking points and questions must reference real things from the research, the kind of detail that signals the candidate did their homework.
- Keep every item tight: one or two sentences. No fluff.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this shape:
{
  "companyOverview": string,
  "techStack": string[],
  "culture": string[],
  "whyThisRole": string,
  "yourEdge": string[],
  "gapsToAddress": string[],
  "smartQuestions": string[],
  "interviewPrep": string[],
  "sources": string[]
}`;

const userPrompt = `COMPANY RESEARCH (from their website):
${JSON.stringify(companyResearch)}

JOB POSTING:
Title: ${job.title}
Company: ${job.company}
Description: ${job.description}
Matched skills (already computed): ${job.matched_skills.join(", ")}
Missing skills (already computed): ${job.missing_skills.join(", ")}

CANDIDATE PROFILE:
Current title: ${profile.current_title}
Experience: ${profile.years_experience} years, level ${profile.experience_level}
Skills: ${profile.skills.join(", ")}
Work history: ${JSON.stringify(profile.work_experience)}`;

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  temperature: 0.4,
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
    { role: "user", content: userPrompt },
  ],
});
```

**Dossier fields:**

| Field           | Type     | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| companyOverview | string   | What the company does                               |
| techStack       | string[] | Technologies they use                               |
| culture         | string[] | Values and working style                            |
| whyThisRole     | string   | Why this role exists                                |
| yourEdge        | string[] | Specific links between THIS candidate and this role |
| gapsToAddress   | string[] | Missing skills reframed as strategy                 |
| smartQuestions  | string[] | Questions that show real research                   |
| interviewPrep   | string[] | Topics to prepare for this role                     |
| sources         | string[] | Pages the company info came from                    |

**Rules:**

- Always use `extract()` with a Zod schema — never parse raw HTML or use regex
- Always wrap every `act()` and `extract()` in try/catch
- Always call `await stagehand.close()` when done — ends the Browserbase session
- Model is always `gpt-4o` — never use other models
- Temperature is `0.4` for synthesis — grounded but flexible enough to make real connections
- Max 3 sub-pages — never exceed this on free plan
- Always close session in finally block — never leave sessions open even if research fails
- Job description and profile always come from DB — never re-fetch via browser
- If browser research returns empty — still run synthesis with job + profile only
- yourEdge, gapsToAddress, and smartQuestions are the most valuable fields — never skip them

## OpenAI GPT-4o

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed OpenAI skill. The skill will have the latest API patterns and model capabilities.

### Structured JSON Response

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY! });

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  temperature: 0.3,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a job matching assistant. Return only valid JSON.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Your prompt here`,
    },
  ],
});

const result = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content!);
```

**Temperature settings:**

- `0.3` — matching, scoring, extraction, research synthesis — deterministic results
- `0.7` — resume generation — natural variation

**Max tokens:**

- Job matching + scoring: `300`
- Company research synthesis: `800`
- Resume generation: `1000`
- Profile extraction from resume: `800`

**Rules:**

- Model string is always `'gpt-4o'` — never use other model names
- Always use `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` for structured data
- Always parse `response.choices[0].message.content` as string — even with json_object it returns a string
- Always validate parsed JSON before using — wrap in try/catch
- Match threshold is always `MATCH_THRESHOLD` from `lib/utils.ts` — never hardcode 70
- Company research synthesis must always return a complete dossier — never return empty even if browser research failed

---

## PostHog

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed PostHog skill. If a PostHog MCP server is configured — use it. The skill/MCP will have the latest client and server patterns.

### Client Setup (Browser)

```typescript
// lib/posthog-client.ts
import posthog from "posthog-js";

export function initPostHog() {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
      api_host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST!,
      capture_pageview: false, // manual pageview tracking
    });
  }
}

// Capture event client-side
posthog.capture("job_found", {
  userId,
  source: "search",
  matchScore: score,
});
```

### Server Setup

```typescript
// lib/posthog-server.ts
import { PostHog } from "posthog-node";

export const createPostHogServer = () =>
  new PostHog(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
    host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST!,
    flushAt: 1, // send immediately
    flushInterval: 0, // no batching — Next.js functions are short-lived
  });

// Always use and shutdown in the same function
const posthog = createPostHogServer();
posthog.capture({
  distinctId: userId,
  event: "company_researched",
  properties: { userId, jobId, company },
});
await posthog.shutdown(); // required — ensures event is sent
```

**Rules:**

- Always call `await posthog.shutdown()` in server-side functions — events are lost without it
- `flushAt: 1` and `flushInterval: 0` always set on server client
- Event names must match exactly the list in `code-standards.md`
- Always include `userId` as a property on every server-side event
- Call `posthog.identify(userId)` after login on client side
- Call `posthog.reset()` on logout on client side

---

## @react-pdf/renderer

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed react-pdf skill. PDF generation APIs can differ from general training knowledge.

### Resume PDF Generation

```typescript
import { renderToBuffer } from '@react-pdf/renderer'
import { Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet } from '@react-pdf/renderer'

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: { padding: 30, fontFamily: 'Helvetica' },
  section: { marginBottom: 10 },
  heading: { fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  text: { fontSize: 10 },
})

const ResumePDF = ({ profile }: { profile: Profile }) => (
  <Document>
    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text style={styles.heading}>{profile.fullName}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{profile.email}</Text>
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
)

// Generate buffer
const buffer = await renderToBuffer(<ResumePDF profile={profile} />)

// Upload directly to InsForge Storage
await insforge.storage
  .from('resumes')
  .upload(`${userId}/resume.pdf`, buffer, {
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    upsert: true
  })
```

**Supported CSS properties:**
Only use these — others are silently ignored:
`padding, margin, fontSize, color, fontFamily, flexDirection, alignItems, justifyContent, borderRadius, width, height, fontWeight, textAlign, lineHeight`

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- Always use `renderToBuffer` — not `renderToStream` or `PDFDownloadLink`
- PDF generation only in `app/api/resume/` routes
- Generated buffer uploaded directly to InsForge Storage — never written to disk
- Always save public URL to DB after upload

---

## pdf-parse

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed pdf-parse skill.

### Extract Text from Uploaded Resume

```typescript
import pdf from "pdf-parse";

// In API route handling resume upload
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("resume") as File;
  const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);

  const pdfData = await pdf(buffer);
  const extractedText = pdfData.text; // raw text content

  // Send to GPT-4o for structured extraction
}
```

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components
- `pdfData.text` is raw unformatted text — the LLM handles the structure extraction
- Always handle parse errors — some PDFs are image-based and return empty text
- **Vision fallback for empty/short text**: when extracted text is < 50 chars (or pdf-parse throws), rasterize the PDF pages with `lib/pdf-vision.ts` (pdfjs-dist + @napi-rs/canvas) and call `extractProfileFromResumeVision()` in `lib/openrouter.ts` with the multimodal model. Use `lib/pdf-vision.ts` as the canonical rasterizer — do NOT introduce `pdf-img-convert` (it pulls in `canvas` which requires a Windows native compile).

---

## pdfjs-dist

**Check first:** Check AGENTS.md for an installed pdfjs-dist skill.

### Rasterize PDF Pages for Vision Models

```typescript
import { rasterizePdfPages } from "@/lib/pdf-vision";

const pages = await rasterizePdfPages(new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer));
// pages[i].base64 is a PNG data string; pages[i].width/height are pixel dimensions
```

**Rules:**

- Server-side only — never import in client components.
- `lib/pdf-vision.ts` already wires up `pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.mjs` with a `@napi-rs/canvas` `NodeCanvasFactory`. Don't rebuild this.
- `next.config.ts` lists `@napi-rs/canvas` and `pdfjs-dist` in `serverExternalPackages` — required because Turbopack cannot bundle the native binding. Keep both entries when bumping either package.
- Caps: max 4 pages per document, max 1600 px on the longest side, scale 1.5 (auto-shrinks to fit the cap). Adjust only with a justified reason.
- **Always copy the input Uint8Array into a fresh `Uint8Array(uint8.byteLength)` + `data.set(uint8)` before passing it to `pdfjs.getDocument({ data })`.** Inside Next.js dev (Turbopack module isolation), the original buffer carries a proxy that pdfjs's worker can't structured-clone — `DataCloneError: Cannot transfer object of unsupported type`. A fresh slice with a brand-new ArrayBuffer is always transferable across the worker boundary. This is already done in `lib/pdf-vision.ts`; do not "optimize" it away.

## @napi-rs/canvas

**Use case:** Server-side canvas for PDF rasterization in Next.js Node runtime.

**Why not `canvas`:** The `canvas` package requires a native compile (Visual Studio on Windows) — no prebuilt binaries for recent Node ABIs. `@napi-rs/canvas` ships prebuilt `.node` binaries and works out of the box.

**Rules:**

- Server-side only.
- Already configured as `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts` — do not remove.
- Use `createCanvas(w, h)` then `.getContext("2d")`; buffer via `canvas.toBuffer("image/png")`.

## OpenRouter vision models

When text-based extraction fails or yields too little content, the resume extract route falls back to a multimodal model.

**Primary:** `google/gemma-4-31b-it:free` — set in `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` in `lib/openrouter.ts`. Supports `image_url` content parts and `response_format: json_object`.

**Pattern for vision extraction:**

```typescript
import { extractProfileFromResumeVision } from "@/lib/openrouter";

const pages = await rasterizePdfPages(uint8); // [{ pageNumber, base64 }, ...]
const result = await extractProfileFromResumeVision(pages);
// result.data is the same JSON shape returned by extractProfileFromResumeWithRetry
```

**Rules:**

- Pass each page as a separate `{ type: "image_url", image_url: { url: "data:image/png;base64,..." } }` content part. Don't concatenate pages into one image.
- The same `SYSTEM_PROMPT` schema from `lib/openrouter.ts` applies — vision and text extraction must return identical shapes so the form-mapper in `ProfileEditor.tsx` doesn't need branching.

**Primary / fallback model chain:**

- Text extraction: `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (currently `inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-fin:free`) → `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL` (`openrouter/free`). The earlier `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct:free` was retired by the provider (returns 404 "no longer free").
- Vision extraction: `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` (`google/gemma-4-31b-it:free`) → `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL`.
- `callExtractionWithFallback()` in `lib/openrouter.ts` only chains to the fallback on transient/model-availability errors (404/429/"no endpoints"). Programming errors (auth, schema) bubble up immediately.
- Free-tier models are subject to daily quotas (50/day for the lowest tier). When the primary model 429s, the user still gets a successful extraction via the fallback. If both fail, the route returns 502 with an actionable message — not a generic "Failed to extract profile from resume."
- Before changing any model constant, verify it's still listed at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` with `pricing.prompt === 0` and `pricing.completion === 0`. Free models get retired frequently.
