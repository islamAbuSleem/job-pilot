## Decisions Made During Build

### 01 Homepage
- Logo and Hero/BottomCta backgrounds use inline `style` gradients — they cannot be expressed via `@theme` color tokens. Documented as the only place these decorative gradients appear.
- Hero/BottomCta primary CTAs use `bg-text-primary` (dark) per the design, not `bg-accent`. Documented as the intended visual.

### 02 Auth
- Used `@insforge/sdk/ssr` (not the older separate `@insforge/ssr` package). Updated `context/library-docs.md` to match.
- Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` — used `proxy.ts` with `updateSession()` from `@insforge/sdk/ssr/middleware`.
- InsForge's browser client is read-only for auth; all mutations (OAuth init, code exchange, sign-out) go through `createAuthActions()` in Server Actions / Route Handlers.
- Homepage auth state is read on the server by checking the `insforge_access_token` cookie — no client-side flash. The cookie check happens in `app/page.tsx` (Server Component) and is passed down to `Navbar`/`Hero`/`BottomCta` as an `isAuthed` prop.
- InsForge config: added `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` to `allowed_redirect_urls` via `npx -y @insforge/cli config apply --auto-approve`. Add prod URL the same way before deploy.

## Notes

### 02 Auth
- `insforge.toml` is the declarative source of truth for InsForge project config — re-export with `npx -y @insforge/cli config export` to refresh it after dashboard changes.
- `npx -y @insforge/cli config apply` requires a TTY. Use `--auto-approve` to apply from non-interactive shells.
- InsForge has `requireEmailVerification: true` but it only gates password sign-up — OAuth users arrive pre-verified through their identity provider. No code change needed for the OAuth flow, but if a password sign-up flow is added later, branch on the response per `.agents/skills/insforge/auth/sdk-integration.md:26-89`.
- `nextPath` post-auth redirect: stored in `insforge_post_auth_redirect` cookie (10 min TTL, httpOnly). `sanitizeNextPath` in `lib/auth-redirect.ts` is the single source of truth for the allowlist (must start with `/`, not `//`, no CR/LF). Lives outside `actions/` because `"use server"` files require every export to be an async function.
- Sign-out clears the auth cookies, so it must run in a Route Handler or a form-submitted Server Action. Next.js blocks cookie writes during a Server Component render. `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` handles the `POST`: it passes `responseCookies` to `createAuthActions()` and `signOut()` deletes `insforge_access_token` and `insforge_refresh_token` on the redirect response — the same pattern as `app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`. A logout control posts to this route; it never calls `signOut()` mid-render.
